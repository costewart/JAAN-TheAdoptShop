## General info
Founded in 2008, Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN) is a non-profit, NGO dedicated to the protection, rescue and rehabilitation of Indonesia’s wildlife and domesticated animals. With marine, wildlife, domesticated and farm animal branches, JAAN devotes all efforts to improving the lives of all Indonesia’s species. With challenges from wildlife black markets to travelling dolphin circuses, the dog-meat industry to dancing street monkeys, JAAN faces unprecendented every day challenges. As a volunteer initiative, this project aims to promote the adoption of JAAN’s rescued cats and dogs, by providing a user-friendly, updated platform for potential adopters to view, search and apply to adopt pets.
